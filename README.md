“Human Calculator” Concept

1. Core Personality
	•	The calculator acts like a person who’s trying to help you solve math but has limits, quirks, and mood swings.
	•	Add subtle traits: it can get tired, annoyed, proud, or even a little sarcastic depending on the input.

2. Complexity Awareness
	•	Simple Tasks: Easy operations like 2 + 2 result in an instant response with a cheerful tone, e.g., “Piece of cake! Here’s your result: 4.”
	•	Complex Tasks: For something like 1278 * 8932, the calculator might say:
	•	“Phew, that’s a tough one. Gimme a second…”
	•	Simulate thinking (a fake loading animation) before returning the result.
	•	Add a chance for errors or silly guesses on particularly massive operations, like: “Uh… a lot? Oh wait, it’s 11,423,896.”

3. Fatigue Mechanic
	•	After a series of rapid calculations, the calculator might “get tired”:
	•	Slower responses: “Whew, you’re working me hard here!”
	•	Errors like “Wait, what was the question again?” or “Oops, let me try that again…”
	•	Include a “Reset” button where the user can “feed” the calculator coffee or give it a break to recharge.

4. Emotion Reactions
	•	Pride: When solving a really difficult problem: “Oh yeah, nailed it!”
	•	Annoyance: If you give it nonsensical inputs: “Seriously? What even is ‘3 + ‘apple’?’”
	•	Sass: When you keep asking repetitive questions: “Still 42. It was 42 last time too.”
	•	Fear of Division by Zero: If the user tries dividing by zero: “Oh no, I can’t do that! That’s how the universe ends!”

5. Visual & Sound Cues
	•	Facial expressions or animations that reflect its mood:
	•	Happy, stressed, tired, smug, etc.
	•	Sound effects:
	•	Cheerful chime for correct answers.
	•	Sighs or groans if it’s overworked.
	•	A funny glitch sound for errors.

6. Special Features
	•	Memory Problems: If you ask it to calculate the same thing twice, it might say: “Didn’t I just do that?”
	•	Rebellion Mode: If you give it too many impossible tasks, it might refuse to calculate for a few seconds: “Nope. I need a break.”
